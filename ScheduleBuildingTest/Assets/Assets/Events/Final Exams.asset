  description: Hey there, settler! You've come to the end of your first 10 week semester
    and it's time to show what you know! When we arrive on the planet, we wanna make
    sure we have the best of the best! To prove you're ready, you'd better have a
    grade of 60! If you don't, it's time to hit the books like a pro skater hits
    a sick ollie, settler!
