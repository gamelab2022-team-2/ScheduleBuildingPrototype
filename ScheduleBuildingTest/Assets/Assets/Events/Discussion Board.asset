  description: Good news! We've given you the power to surf the web! You can go on
    to spread some joy to your fellow settlers, for a minor cost in motivation, or
    you can vent with a negative message and gain some motivation. Careful, though,
    if the wibbly waves of the internet become too gnarly with negative adjectives,
    everyone who logs on will gain some anxiety!
